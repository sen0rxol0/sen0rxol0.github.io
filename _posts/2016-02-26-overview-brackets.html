<p><a target="_blank" href="http://brackets.io/"><b>Brackets</b></a> is a open source text&sol;code editor, founded by <b>Adobe</b> to provide Developers a lightweight and powerful editor. Brackets has a lot of features and tools that can enhance code development process, although web development is its core, it can be used for any development that involves code development.</p>

<p>This article will be focused on a variety of brackets features, available options, usage and thoughts.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Brackets as some of the best features that a developer can which for in a text editor.</p>

</dl>

<p>Now, by any means those are all of them, those are just the highlights of my choosing.</p>

<h2>Available Options</h2>

<p>With Brackets you have a variety of options, from spliting the view to creating your own themes, this section might also be looked as custumization options.</p>

<h4>Split View</h4>
<p>Editor&lpar;pane&rpar; in brackets can be more than one on the main view, the view can be splited into Two at the menu bar <b>View &rsaquo; Vertical View</b> or <b>View &rsaquo; Horizontal View</b>, the same thing can also be done in the <b>top right corner</b> on the sidebar.</p>

<h4>Sidebar</h4>
<p>The sidebar can be hidden or shown at <b>View &rsaquo; Show&sol;Hide Sidebar.</b> Located in the left side of the main view, the sidebar provides informatios such as, the current open file, edited files&lpar;working files&rpar;, unsaved files, working folders and if the view is splited the editors will also have splited lists of files inside the sidebar for each one of them.</p>
<p>In the sidebar, folders can be opened and created, files can be created, renamed, deleted, moved between editors&lpar;if more than one&rpar; and saved, anytime a file is open and edited, that file goes to <b>Working Files</b> and  all of these happen within the <b>Working Folder,</b> which might be your entire project and its structure.</p>

<h4>Quick View</h4>
<p>This is also one of brackets helpful features, it works on <b>Hover</b>, in other words, when you place the cursor over a image for example, that image is shown in a tooltip way. This feature also works with colors in CSS files, and it can be desabled at <b>View &rsaquo; Quick View on Hover.</b></p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Brackets can be even further custumized with themes, themes can change the colors that highlight your code, they can change fonts of the editor, and even the whole brackets layout can be changed with a simple change of theme.</p>
<p>Themes can be instaled or removed through the <b>Extension Manager</b> and they can be selected at <b>View &rsaquo; Themes&mldr;</b>, where you also have other customization options such as <b>font size and family.</b></p>

<h4>Live Preview Highlight</h4>
<p>This is one of the options that i liked the most, when in <b>Live Preview</b> mode you get highlighted preview for the element you currenty have your cursor on, the feature is cursor-driven, it can be desabled by unchecking <b>View &rsaquo; Live Preview Highlight.</b>  </p>

<h4>More Options</h4>
<p>In Brackets you can <b>Increase, Decrease or Restore Font Size</b> through the <b>View Menu</b>, your lines can be numbered <b>&lpar; View &rsaquo; Line Numbers &rpar;</b>, blocks of code can be collapsed, cursor can be changed, overall Brackets as a wide variety of options to suit anyone&#39;s taste.</p>

<p>Options can be even further explored in the editor preferences files, read more about preferences from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets#preferences">Brackets Wiki</a>.</p>


<h2>Working in Brackets</h2>
<p>Personally, i found brackets very welcoming, the defaults are very good and is not likely that you will encounter any problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>With support for almost all modern languages, you&#39;ll start coding right after the installation.</p>

<figure class="article_snapshot ">
    <img src="../../../assets/img/snapshots/brackets-snapshot01.png" alt="Brackets code editor snapshot" width="100%" height="100%">
    <figcaption>Brackets main environment.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The snapshot above shows the simplicity of brackets, and, a vair amount of earlier discused topics can be further clarified and identified. Now, for a closer look a fast installation of <a target="_blank" href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> would give even more details about the environment.</p>

<p>Being a folder based coder editor, a good starting point is to open a project folder <b>File &rsaquo; Open Folder&mldr;</b> or from the sidebar. New files can also be added or created in one of those two methods.</p>

<h4>Working with files</h4>
<p>Editing files is very pleasant and with the features, editing becomes quite rich. Also, you have full control over your editor, it can be easily customized just by exploring through the available options, it won&#39;t take much to find what you like and feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>Now, working with files is straightfoward, all the files will be listed on the sidebar, <b>Working Files</b> on the top and <b>Working Folder</b>&lpar; the whole project &rpar; will be right bellow. If the sidebar is somehow distracting, you can hide it or opt to select the no distraction mode at <b>View &rsaquo; No Distractions.</b></p>

<p>In no distractions mode you will not be able to see the tree of files in your project , but, you can easily navigate through your files by accessing the <b>Navigate</b> menu, where you have a variety of helpful features such as <b>Quick Open</b>&lpar; open files  with a simple search in the whole project &rpar;, <b>Next or Previous Document</b> by working order or by list order.</p>

<p>Depending on your preferences, the cursor mode can be changed between <b>Insert</b> or <b>Overwrite</b> mode at the <b>bottom right corner</b>, how your code is indented can be fully customized also at the <b>bottom right corner</b> and your options are between <b>Tab Size</b>&lpar; which the character width can be specified &rpar; or in <b>Spaces.</b></p>

<p>When you start to write your code you&#39;ll experience <b>Code Hints</b> and <b>Auto Completion</b>, they are active by default and can on be disabled in the default preferences file &lpar; <b>Debug &rsaquo; Open Preferences File</b> &rpar;.
A good amound of editing utilities can be found under the <b>Edit</b> menu, some basic and some not, but, they can definitely help you write faster and cleaner code.</p>

<p>If you write a lot of code in one file and you often get lost in your code, Brackets helps you find whatever you need to search&sol;find or change in your project, you can  quickly search&lpar; find only &rpar; inside the working file &lpar; <b>Find &rsaquo; Find</b> &rpar; or inside the working folder &lpar; project &rpar; at <b>Find &rsaquo; Find In Files</b>, or, you can find and replace <b>Find &rsaquo; Replace&sol;Replace In Files.</b></p>

<p>As soon as you start to really get things done with Brackets you&#39;ll begin to use and feel the power of its features, when working with <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML</b> documents in particular, <b>Quick Edit</b> will be helpful to quickly modify styles from within the html file, no need to go search for that one selector in one long css file, you can just place your cursor over a element, class or id that needs quick modification, select <b>Navigate &rsaquo; Quick Edit</b> and you&#39;ll be presented with a inline editor that searches for your selection in the stylesheets linked to the html file so you can make your changes. Optinally you can also use <b>Navigate &rsaquo; Quick Jump To&sol;Find Definition</b> that can be used to perform a jump&lpar; go to  &rpar; within a file based on selectors, functions names, etc.</p>

<h4>Working with Live Preview</h4>
<p>The feature is basically a local server that serves your files statically, the preview is instantly, your browser as real-time updates while you write code, you can lunch it from within a html file by selecting <b>File &rsaquo; Live Preview</b> or by clicking the first icon <b>&lpar; lightning bolt &rpar;</b> from the panel at right corner, currently the feature is limited to only work with <i>Chrome.</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets#live-preview">Read more</a> about this feature.</p>

<h4>Working with Extract</h4>

<p>Now, extract is a feature that might or might not be on your Brackets installation package, it depends if you choose the package that comes with it when downloading Brackets, but if not, you can install it from the <b>Extension Manager</b>.</p>
<p>It is certainly going to change your development process, but it is also a <b>Creative Cloud</b> service so you&#39;ll probably need a account to sign in with.</p>
<p>Once you open <b>Extract</b> on the <b>right corner panel</b> and sign in with your <b>Adobe ID</b> you can start by opening your design file, then you can start extrating informations. At the right panel of Extract there is a list of <b>Layers</b> just like in <b>Photoshop</b>, and at the main panel you get a preview of the file, when you select a element you get width and height and its absolute position, and by holding <b>Shift</b> when doing a selection you get the element&#39;s relative position to other element, but the extension becomes useful when used within a <b>CSS</b> document, in other words, when you select a element in extract you can go in your CSS and press <b>Ctrl &#43; Space</b>  to get its CSS propreties.</p>


<h4>Installing Extensions</h4>
<p>All extensions are managed through the <b>Extension Manager</b> at the <b>right corner panel</b>, whitin the Extension Manager you have three panels, <b>Available, Themes</b> and <b>Installed</b>, you can <b>Search</b> for extensions in the search bar or you can install them by <b>dragging and dropping</b> zip files or <b>Install from URL</b> links, you can <b>disable</b> or <b>remove</b>  them at the installed panel.</p>
<p>There is a lot to choose from the <b>Extension Manager</b>, and in case of doubt you can click <b>more info</b> which will probably take you to a web page with informations about it, visit <a target="_blank" href="https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com/"><b>Brackets Extension Registry</b></a> to browse through them all.  </p>


<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
<p>The code editor is keyboard friendly and pretty much almost everything can be accessed with a shortcut, i think that shortcuts are very helpful as they give you a way of keeping your hands off of the touchpad and enhance the whole development process, so, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Shortcuts">see</a> the list of shortcuts available in Brackests, take a look and if you don&#39;t grab much you can also see the shortcuts inside of Brackets on the submenus or <b>Debug &rsaquo; Show Developer Tools &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; Shortcuts.</b></p>

<h2>Final Insight</h2>
<p>I use Brackets on a daily basis and i&#39;ve yet to find some reason not to, its a powerful, simple, flexible and a keyboard friendly text editor that is nicely developed, and, open sourced with great contributions from its community.</p>

<p>There is a lot more to it than just this overview, but i hope this will get you started with a good base, although if you get to mess in Brackets you&#39;ll get to see that Brackets is very straightforward.</p>
