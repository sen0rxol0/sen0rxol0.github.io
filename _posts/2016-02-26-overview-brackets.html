<p>This article will be focused on a variety of brackets features, available options, usage and thoughts.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Brackets as some of the best features that a developer can which for in a code editor.</p>

</dl>

<p>Now, by any means those are all of them, those are just the highlights of my choosing.</p>

<h2>Available Options</h2>

<p>With Brackets you have a variety of options, from spliting the view to creating your own themes, this section might also be looked as custumization options.</p>

<h4>Split View</h4>
<p>Editor&lpar;pane&rpar; in brackets can be more than one on the main view, the view can be splited into Two at the menu bar <b>View &rsaquo; Vertical View</b> or <b>View &rsaquo; Horizontal View</b>, the same thing can also be done in the <b>top right corner</b> on the sidebar.</p>

<h4>Sidebar</h4>
<p>The sidebar can be hidden or shown at <b>View &rsaquo; Show&sol;Hide Sidebar.</b> Located in the left side of the main view, the sidebar provides informatios such as, the current open file, edited files&lpar;working files&rpar;, unsaved files, working folders and if the view is splited the editors will also have splited lists of files inside the sidebar for each one of them.</p>
<p>In the sidebar, folders can be opened and created, files can be created, renamed, deleted, moved between editors&lpar;if more than one&rpar; and saved, anytime a file is open and edited, that file goes to <b>Working Files</b> and  all of these happen within the <b>Working Folder,</b> which might be your entire project and its structure.</p>

<h4>Quick View</h4>
<p>This is also one of brackets helpful features, it works on <b>Hover</b>, in other words, when you place the cursor over a image for example, that image is shown in a tooltip way. This feature also works with colors in CSS files, and it can be desabled at <b>View &rsaquo; Quick View on Hover.</b></p>

<h4>Themes</h4>
<p>Brackets can be even further custumized with themes, themes can change the colors that highlight your code, they can change fonts of the editor, and even the whole brackets layout can be changed with a simple change of theme.</p>
<p>Themes can be instaled or removed through the <b>Extension Manager</b> and they can be selected at <b>View &rsaquo; Themes&mldr;</b>, where you also have other customization options such as <b>font size and family.</b></p>

<h4>Live Preview Highlight</h4>
<p>This is one of the options that i liked the most, when in <b>Live Preview</b> mode you get highlighted preview for the element you currenty have your cursor on, the feature is cursor-driven, it can be desabled by unchecking <b>View &rsaquo; Live Preview Highlight.</b>  </p>

<h4>Other Options</h4>
<p>In Brackets you can <b>Increase, Decrease or Restore Font Size</b> through the <b>View Menu</b>, your lines can be numbered <b>&lpar; View &rsaquo; Line Numbers &rpar;</b>, blocks of code can be collapsed, cursor can be changed, overall Brackets as a wide variety of options to suit anyone&#39;s taste.</p>


<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Personally, i found brackets very welcoming, the defaults are very good and is not likely that you will encounter any problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>With support for almost all modern languages, you&#39;ll start coding right after the installation.</p>

<p>The snapshot above shows the simplicity of brackets, and, a vair amount of earlier discused topics can be further clarified and identified. Now, for a closer look a fast installation of <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> would give even more details about the environment.</p>

<p>Being a folder based coder editor, a good starting point is to open a project folder <b>File &rsaquo; Open Folder&mldr;</b> or from the sidebar, new files can also be added or created in one of those two ways.</p>

<p>Now, working with files is straightfoward, all the files will be listed on the sidebar, <b>Working Files</b> on the top and <b>Working Folder</b>&lpar; the whole project &rpar; will be right bellow. If the sidebar is somehow distracting, you can hide it or opt to select the no distraction mode at <b>View &rsaquo; No Distractions.</b></p>

<p>In no distractions mode you will not be able to see the tree of files in your project , but, you can easily navigate through your files by accessing the <b>Navigate</b> menu, where you have a variety of helpful features such as <b>Quick Open</b>&lpar; open files  with a simple search in the whole project &rpar;, <b>Next or Previous Document</b> by working order or by list order.</p>


<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
<p>The code editor is keyboard friendly and pretty much almost everything can be accessed with a shortcut, i think that shortcuts are very helpful as they give you a way of keeping your hands off of the touchpad and enhance the whole development process, so, here is a <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Shortcuts">link</a> for a list of shortcuts available in Brackests, take a look and if you don&#39;t grab much you can also see the shortcuts inside of Brackets on the submenus or  <b>Debug &rsaquo; Show Developer Tools &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; Shortcuts.</b></p>
