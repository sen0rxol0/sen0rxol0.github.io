<p>With Brackets you have a variety of options, from spliting the view to creating your own themes, this section might also be custumization options.</p>

<h3>Split View</h3>
<p>Editor&lpar;pane&rpar; in brackets can be more than one on the main view, the view can be splited into Two at the menu bar <b>View &rsaquo; Vertical View</b> or <b>View &rsaquo; Horizontal View</b>, the same thing can also be done in the <b>top right corner</b> on the sidebar.</p>

<h3>Sidebar</h3>
<p>The sidebar can be hidden or shown at <b>View &rsaquo; Show&sol;Hide Sidebar.</b> Located in the left side of the main view, the sidebar provides informatios such as, the current open file, edited files&lpar;working files&rpar;, unsaved files, working folders and if the view is splited the editors will also have splited lists of files inside the sidebar for each one of them.</p>
<p>In the sidebar, folders can be opened and created, files can be created, renamed, deleted, moved between editors&lpar;if more than one&rpar; and saved, anytime a file is open and edited, that file goes to <b>Working Files</b> and  all of these happen within the <b>Working Folder,</b> which might be your entire project and its structure.</p>

<h3>Quick View</h3>
<p>This is also one of brackets helpful features, it works on <b>Hover</b>, in other words, when you place the cursor over a image for example, that image is shown in a tooltip way. This feature also works with colors in CSS files, and it can be desabled at <b>View &rsaquo; Quick View on Hover.</b></p>
